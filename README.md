The website should be easy to use and navigate, with a clear and concise booking process. It should also be mobile-friendly, so that users can book a taxi from anywhere.

The homepage of the website should prominently feature a booking form, so that users can easily book a taxi without having to browse through the website. The booking form should include the following fields:
Pick-up location
Drop-off location
Date and time of the booking
Number of passengers
Special requests (e.g., wheelchair accessible, child seat)
The website should also include a map of the service area, so that users can see where taxis are available. It should also have a list of frequently asked questions, so that users can find answers to their questions without having to contact customer support.
